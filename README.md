These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

First, just clone it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Soohan-Park/customized-create-next-app.git
# Or `gh repo clone Soohan-Park/customized-create-next-app`
```

And, you need to `yarn` package manager. (If you don't want it, you can using `npm`.)

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Installing

Install dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

And you did all what you need. Just run!

```bash
yarn start # Or `yarn dev`
```

**(Optional) If you need a Custom Server on NextJS, please check [this document](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) and follow instruction below.**

Let's start to making a Custom Server on NextJS!

You need to install more packages like below.

```bash
yarn add express ts-node
yarn add --dev @types/express
```

And correct `package.json`.

```json
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next build && NODE_ENV=production ts-node server.ts",  // Here!
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  ...
```

Also, `tsconfig.json`.

```json
  ...
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
  // Activate these lines.
  "ts-node": {
    "transpileOnly": true,
    "compilerOptions": {
      "module": "commonjs"
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, activate `server.ts` file.

```typescript
/**
 * NextJS Custom Server w/ Express
 * If you don't need a server, you can delete this file.
 */

import next from "next";
import express from "express";

// const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) || 3000;
const port = 3000;
const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";
const app = next({ dev });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(async () => {
  const server = express();

  server.all("*", (req, res) => {
    return handle(req, res);
  });

  server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`> Ready on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
});
```
